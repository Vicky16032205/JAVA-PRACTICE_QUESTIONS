# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** Practice Repository! This repository is a collection of all the DSA problems I solve while improving my coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. I will regularly update this repository with solutions to various problems across different topics in DSA.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on topics. Each folder contains solutions to problems related to that topic. Here’s the structure:

```
.
├── .vscode
├── ArrayList
├── Arrays
├── DOUBLE_AND_CIRCULAR_LL
├── GFG_160_Days_Problems
├── Linked_List
├── PATTERN
├── Recursion
└── Sorting_Algorithms
```

### Folder Descriptions
- **ArrayList**: Contains problems and solutions related to ArrayLists.
- **Arrays**: Solutions for problems involving arrays, including operations and optimizations.
- **DOUBLE_AND_CIRCULAR_LL**: Implementation and problems related to doubly and circular linked lists.
- **GFG_160_Days_Problems**: Solutions for GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of DSA Challenge.
- **Linked_List**: Problems and solutions focused on singly and basic linked list operations.
- **PATTERN**: Coding problems involving patterns and designs.
- **Recursion**: Solutions for recursion-based problems and techniques.
- **Sorting_Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms and related problems.
