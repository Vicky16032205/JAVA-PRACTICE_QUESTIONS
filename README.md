# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** Practice Repository! This repository is a collection of all the DSA problems I solve to sharpen my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. I will continuously update this repository with solutions to problems across various DSA topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on topics. Each folder contains solutions and implementations related to that topic. Hereâ€™s the structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ArrayList
â”œâ”€â”€ Arrays
â”œâ”€â”€ DOUBLE_AND_CIRCULAR_LL
â”œâ”€â”€ GFG_160_Days_Problems
â”œâ”€â”€ Graphs
â”œâ”€â”€ Linked_List
â”œâ”€â”€ PATTERN
â”œâ”€â”€ Recursion
â”œâ”€â”€ Sorting_Algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ Stack
â””â”€â”€ trees
```

### Folder Descriptions

- **ArrayList**: Problems and solutions related to ArrayList operations and implementations.
- **Arrays**: Solutions for array-based problems, including common operations and optimizations.
- **DOUBLE_AND_CIRCULAR_LL**: Implementation and problems related to doubly linked lists and circular linked lists.
- **GFG_160_Days_Problems**: Solutions for the "GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of DSA Challenge."
- **Linked_List**: Implementation of singly linked lists and solutions to related problems.
- **PATTERN**: Coding problems involving pattern printing and design techniques.
- **Recursion**: Solutions to recursion-based problems and techniques.
- **Sorting_Algorithms**: Implementations of popular sorting algorithms and related problems.
- **Stack**: Implementation of stack operations (push, pop, peek, display, size, and isEmpty) using arrays and Linked Lists . Also interview related problems are solved and updated directly into the repository.
- **trees**: Implementations of trees and questions related to Binary Search Trees will be find here.

## Languages Used

I am using **Java** as the primary programming language for all solutions.
